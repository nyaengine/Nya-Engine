## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Virus01Official/Nya-Engine.git
```

### 2. Install LÃ–VE2D:
- Download [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/) (version 11.3 or newer).
- Follow the installation instructions on the LÃ–VE2D website.

### 3. Run the Engine:
```bash
love Nya-Engine
```

## Usage

### Creating Your First Object
1. Open Nya Engine and load the default scene.
2. Click on the **"Add Object"** button to create a new game object. You can also use scripting to create objects. Example: 
```lua
   local newObject = ObjectLibrary:new(x, y, width, height, image) -- image is optional
  ```
3. Use the UI tools to modify its properties:
   - **Position**: Drag and drop the object to set its position.
   - **Size & Color**: Customize the object's size and color using the built-in tools.
   - **Physics**: Enable physics for the object (gravity, collision detection, etc.).

## UI Features

Nya Engine features a kawaii-themed UI designed for ease of use and functionality:

- **Object Creation**: Easily add new objects to the scene using the UI buttons.
- **Scene Management**: Switch between scenes with ease using the scene manager.
- **UI Customization**: Use the built-in UI tools to customize buttons, sliders, and layouts.
- **Physics Control**: Toggle between static, dynamic, and kinematic physics types for objects.
- **Color Picker**: Adjust the color of objects with an RGB slider for precise color control.

## Visual and Lua Coding

Nya Engine supports both **Visual Coding** and **Lua Scripting**:

- **Visual Coding**: Use a drag-and-drop interface to create game logic without writing code. This is perfect for those who want to quickly prototype or don't have coding experience.
- **Lua Scripting**: For developers who prefer to write code, Nya Engine fully supports Lua scripting, allowing you to create complex game mechanics, handle events, and interact with the engineâ€™s features.

## Scenes & Objects

- **Scenes**: Nya Engine supports multiple scenes, allowing you to manage different parts of your game (e.g., menus, levels) with ease. Switch between scenes through scripting or UI controls.
- **Objects**: Objects are the building blocks of your game, and you can add, delete, and manipulate them within the engine. Each object can have its own properties like position, size, color, and physics.
